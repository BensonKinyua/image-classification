# image-classification
The Dogs & Cats is a foundational problem for a basic CNN(convolutional neural network) model which involves classifying images as a dog or a cat.The dataset can be used for learning how to develop,evaluate and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for classification of images. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, exploring improvements for the model by changing the paramters of the model, saving and loading the model to make predicitions on new data.
